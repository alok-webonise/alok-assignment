                                When you’re finished, Shareist makes it easy to turn it into a great looking eBook.</p>

                                tweets on your subject. Work on your posts in private, and when they’re ready, publish them on your Notebook or export them to your Wordpress blog.</p>

                                family and friends. Jot down stuff you want to buy, or read later. Keep some stuff private, and other stuff public. Share just the best stuff to Facebook and your blog.</p>
